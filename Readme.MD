* Liveness Probe and Readiness Probe are used in Kubernetes to monitor the health and availability of containers:
    * Liveness Probe checks if the container is alive. If it fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts the container.
    ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Detect and recover from application crashes or hangs.

    * Readiness Probe checks if the container is ready to handle traffic. If it fails, the container is removed from the load balancer.
    ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Prevent sending requests to an unready or initializing service.
Both help ensure high availability and smooth operation of applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
